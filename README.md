# self-assessment-2
This project attempts to use JavaScript &amp; AJAX to load 50 AirBNB listings. 

My creative addition was the use of Bootstrap Accordions to give the page a more concise layout as there is a lot of information.
I used AJAX to load the CSV file.

Some of the images are simply incorrect / out-dated, so I included an alt attribute for the images that do not load.
For the amenities, I didn't go through the process of parsing it cleanly and instead just using the direct JSON field. You will notice some inconsistencies and interesting formatting decisions in that data because of this. But, the scope of this self-assessment was to learn AJAX and explore BootStrap / JS, so I decided not to focus on that.
